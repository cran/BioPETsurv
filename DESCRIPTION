Description: Prognostic Enrichment is a strategy of enriching a clinical trial for testing an intervention intended to prevent or delay an unwanted clinical event.  A prognostically enriched trial enrolls only patients who are more likely to experience the unwanted clinical event than the broader patient population (R. Temple (2010) <doi:10.1038/clpt.2010.233>). By testing the intervention in an enriched study population, the trial may be adequately powered with a smaller sample size, which can have both practical and ethical advantages.
    This package provides tools to evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials with survival/time-to-event outcomes.
